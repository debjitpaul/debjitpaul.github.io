# Making Reasoning Matter: Measuring and Improving Faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks when prompted to generate step-by-step explanations, known as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, a critical question remains: **Do these models actually use their generated reasoning steps to arrive at their final answers?**

## The Problem

While CoT prompting improves performance on many reasoning tasks, recent studies suggest that models might not always rely on their intermediate reasoning steps. This raises concerns about the **faithfulness** of the reasoning process - whether the generated explanations truly reflect the model's decision-making process.

## Our Approach

In our paper ["Making Reasoning Matter"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13950), we introduce a comprehensive framework to measure and improve reasoning faithfulness using **causal mediation analysis**.

### Key Contributions

1. **Causal Framework**: We develop a method to quantify how much intermediate reasoning steps causally influence final predictions
2. **Extensive Evaluation**: Analysis across 11 different language models on multiple reasoning tasks
3. **Practical Improvements**: Techniques to enhance reasoning faithfulness

## Key Findings

Our causal mediation analysis across different model families reveals several important insights:

### Model Behavior Varies by Training Objective

- **In-context learning** and **instruction-tuning** improve alignment with reasoning chains
- Models trained with **RLHF** show more direct effects than indirect effects, suggesting potential issues with faithful reasoning
- **Larger models** don't automatically show better faithfulness

### Task-Specific Patterns

We evaluated on three types of reasoning tasks:

- **Mathematical Reasoning** (GSM8K)
- **Strategic Reasoning** (StrategyQA)
- **Causal Understanding**

Results show that faithfulness varies significantly across task types, with mathematical reasoning showing different patterns compared to strategic reasoning tasks.

## Methodology

Our approach uses **causal mediation analysis** to decompose the total effect of reasoning problems into:

1. **Direct Effect**: How much the problem directly influences the answer (bypassing reasoning)
2. **Indirect Effect**: How much the problem influences the answer through generated reasoning steps

High indirect effect indicates faithful reasoning, while high direct effect suggests the model might be ignoring its reasoning steps.

## Implications

This work has important implications for:

- **Model Development**: Understanding which training objectives promote faithful reasoning
- **Evaluation**: Moving beyond accuracy to assess reasoning quality
- **Trust and Interpretability**: Building more reliable and transparent AI systems

## Future Directions

Our findings open several avenues for future research:

- Developing training methods that promote faithfulness
- Creating better evaluation metrics for reasoning quality
- Understanding the relationship between model scale and reasoning faithfulness
