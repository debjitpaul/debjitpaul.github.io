Hi there! I'm a Research Scientist at Noah Ark's Lab, London. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher working with
<a href="https://people.epfl.ch/antoine.bosselut" target="_blank">Antoine Bosselut</a>,
<a href="https://people.epfl.ch/boi.faltings" target="_blank">Boi Faltings</a>, and
<a href="https://people.epfl.ch/robert.west" target="_blank">Robert West</a>
<!--<a href="https://lia.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">LIA lab</a>,
                                <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">dLab</a>, and
                                <a href="https://nlp.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">NLP</a> --> at
<a href="https://www.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">EPFL</a>. Before EPFL, I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of
<a href="http://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/~frank/" target="_blank"> Anette Frank </a> in the Department of Computational Linguistics at
<a href="https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/nlpgroup/#landing" target="_blank"> Heidelberg University </a> and was also a part of the Research Training Group AIPHES. <br />

<!--The core of my research lies at the convergence of Linguistics, Cognitive Science, and AI. Currently, my research focuses on (controllable) text generation, commonsense reasoning, and unsupervised learning.

The research topics that I focus on are as follows: <br />

<ul>
  <li><b> Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning </b>: I'm interested in improving the ability of existing AI systems to think logically by developing techniques for integrating structured knowledge into AI systems.  <br /></li>
  <li><b> Interactive methods </b>: I'm interested in building interactive methods that make human interaction with AI more intuitive. <br /></li>
  <li><b> Commonsense Reasoning </b>: I'm interested in constructing data and models that leverage commonsense knowledge derived from language and graphical representations to facilitate commonsense reasoning and its practical applications. <br /></li>
</ul>

Finally, my long-term research objective is to imbue machines with human-like communication abilities and commonsense knowledge and reasoning capabilities. Build AI systems that can do complex interplay between language, knowledge representation, and cognitive reasoning processes.-->

My overarching research objective is to enhance the <b>reasoning capabilities of artificial agents</b> by advancing their ability to understand the complex interplay between language, knowledge representation, and cognitive reasoning processes. To accomplish this goal, I have focused my investigations on three areas:

<ul>
<li><b>Neuro-symbolic Reasoning</b> - AI systems must integrate structured, symbolic knowledge with neural representations to capture knowledge dynamics and generalise robustly to unseen situations. My research has focused on developing computational models that perform reasoning by combining the expressiveness of symbolic structures with the adaptability of neural architectures. <br /></li>
<li><b>Learning to generate explanations for reasoning</b> - When a model explains its decision-making steps or logical steps it took to reach that conclusion, it enhances transparency and helps build trust in the system. My research has focused on designing computational models that generate explanations before making the final decisions.<br /></li>
<li><b>Aligning Models with Human or AI Feedback</b> - Text generation models are observed to display undesired and inconsistent behaviours, such as hallucination and unfaithful reasoning. My research has focused on designing methods to rectify the undesired behaviours of text generation models through interaction.<br /></li>
</ul>
